                <p class="articleBody">
                    Ukrainian women's biathlon team consisting of <span class="keywords">Anastasia Merkushyna</span>, <span class="keywords">Yulia Dzhyma</span>, <span class="keywords">Vita Semerenko</span> and <span class="keywords">Olena Pidhrushna</span> has won the bronze medal in the relay race (4x6 km) at the World Championship in Italian Antholz-Anterselva on Saturday.
                    Ukrainians' good shooting and the rivals' mistakes allowed Pidhrushna in the fourth stage to leave the shooting range to the last lap of the second, noticeably behind the Norwegians following the third relay gold in this Championship and slightly ahead of rivals from several other teams.
                    A representative of the German national team beat Pidhrushna before the finish. At the same time, the Ukrainian woman did not let the next athletes from the Czech Republic and Sweden go.
                    This is the first medal of Ukrainian athletes in this championship.
                    The Norwegian team won gold, and Germany took the second place.
                    The relay race among men will also take place on Saturday, and the World Championship is to end on Sunday with mass starts.

                <p class="articleBody">
                    <span class="keywords">The National Bank of Ukraine</span> (NBU) on Friday increased its offer to exchange non-cash euros for cash to EUR 200 million, Deputy Governor of the NBU Oleg Churiy has said.
                    "We saw a trend at the beginning of this week when banks did not have enough cash. This is due to problems with air traffic. We were involved in the solution of this problem and have already provided the banks with a sufficient number of banknotes in euros. Yesterday we held the first auction ... We sold EUR 100 million, the demand was EUR 36 million. Today we are holding another auction, already for EUR 200 million in cash euros for non-cash euros," Churiy said during an online briefing on Friday.
                    The central bank will report on the results of the auction at the end of the working day.
